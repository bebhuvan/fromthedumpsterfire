### Living like life itself edition {.wp-block-heading}

I couldn’t write for the past two weeks due to various reasons. So, I&#8217;m sorry that you&#8217;ve become less intelligent without my wisdom.

A couple of months ago, when I was scrolling on the Substack app, I came across&nbsp;[this parable][1]&nbsp;by Chuang Tzu, a Chinese philosopher and a foundational figure of Taoism.

Since the beginning of this year, I’ve been going down the rabbit hole of philosophy. To me, the best thing about philosophy is that it grabs you by the shoulders like a tender lover and then violently shakes you until some earwax comes loose and your brain restarts. A curse and a blessing of modernity is that many of us lead structured, cocooned, and cosseted lives. There are no lions and tigers looking to turn us into high-protein snacks anymore.

Given our material comforts, we&#8217;ve become zombies, going through the motions of life without having to think or question anything. This kind of living leads to a buildup of plaque on our minds and souls. The longer this goes unnoticed, the more calcified the plaque becomes. Every once in a while, we need something subversive that shatters our comfortable delusions. Something that forces us to re-examine our strongest ideas and beliefs.

In reading philosophy books and listening to philosophers, I&#8217;ve come to realize that philosophy&#8217;s role is to do just this. A lot of what passes for modern philosophy is grotesque and conceited mental masturbation. But beneath all the sticky mental ejaculate, there’s a rich and ancient world of subversive delights that awaits us. This Taoist parable is one such example.

I wanted to share this as soon as I read it, but I wanted to let it marinate in my head a little and try to understand it better. I won&#8217;t claim to have understood this fully, but I&#8217;ve been rereading it. With each reading, the many hidden meanings in the parable start to become a little less foggy. But what&#8217;s clear is that it will force you to question a lot of things. You may also discover something about yourself in the process of reading the parable.

    The parable seems to have been a translation from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.in/Way-Chuang-Tze-2e/dp/0811218511">The Way of Chuang Tzu by Thomas Merton</a>. Another book gets added to my long list of&nbsp;<s>regrets, sorry&nbsp;</s>reading list.

Given the gap since the last post, I have many things to share, but I will refrain. This parable is the only thing I want you to think about. I would also love to hear your thoughts in the comments.
