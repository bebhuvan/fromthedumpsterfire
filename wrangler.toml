# Custom domain routes (configure in Cloudflare Dashboard after adding domain)
# Uncomment and redeploy after domain is added to Cloudflare:
#
# [[routes]]
# pattern = "fromthedumpsterfire.com/*"
# zone_name = "fromthedumpsterfire.com"
#
# [[routes]]
# pattern = "www.fromthedumpsterfire.com/*"
# zone_name = "fromthedumpsterfire.com"

# Note: Both domains will serve the site. Create a Redirect Rule in
# Cloudflare Dashboard to redirect www â†’ non-www for SEO best practices.
