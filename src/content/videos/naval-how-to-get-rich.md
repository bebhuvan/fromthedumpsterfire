excerpt: "Louis C.K.'s latest special is an hour of unfiltered, absurdist comedy that reminds you why laughter matters—especially when the world feels heavy."
context: "Think what you will about Louis CK as a person, but he's still ridiculously funny. This special popped up on my feed and I started watching it, and it's absolutely hilarious."
curatorNotes: "Considering how dark and depressing the world feels right now, I think we could all use the laughs. I'll leave the judgment about Louis CK and his character to you, but I still think this set is fucking hilarious. Some of the jokes are so good I'm literally unable to stop laughing even as I type this."

This is one of those sets where you're reminded why standup comedy exists. It's raw, uncomfortable at times, and absolutely hysterical.

Louis C.K. has always had this ability to take everyday observations and twist them into something absurd and profound at the same time. This special is no different. Whether you think he should still have a platform is a question you'll have to answer for yourself, but the comedy itself is undeniably sharp.

The world is heavy right now. Sometimes you just need to laugh at something ridiculous. This delivers that in spades.
