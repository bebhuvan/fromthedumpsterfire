curatorNotes: "A deeply personal reflection that becomes a broader meditation on what we lose when we stop wrestling with words ourselves. The connection between writing and thinking isn't just metaphorical—Dean argues it's the foundation of personal sovereignty in an age of algorithmic influence. The question isn't whether AI can write better, but whether we can think as clearly without the struggle of arranging our own words."
excerpt: "As AI makes writing effortless, we face an uncomfortable question: if we stop wrestling with words ourselves, do we lose the ability to think deeply? Michael Dean argues that writing isn't just communication—it's how we earn back our cognitive agency."
pullQuote: "Writing and arranging words is the process of careful thinking. By offloading it, will we not atrophy the muscles of thought?"

I like writing. I think it's easily one of the best things to have happened in my life. If I can confidently say I'm a little less stupid, it's because of writing. Writing pushed me to read more, and reading more pushed me to write more. It became a kind of feedback loop.

But today, thanks to Greg Lelhans, anyone can write better than most writers. In fact, if someone has an interesting or thoughtful take, they can now produce writing as good as some of the best.

But the real question is: **are they really writing?** And the obvious answer is: they're not. They're relying on large language models.

The bigger question is: **what's the cost of relying on these tools?** What do we lose when we stop wrestling with words ourselves? Maybe we lose the ability to think deeply, to wrestle with hard questions, to come up with clever formulations, to sit uncomfortably with uncertainty and be okay without answers.

I don't know. I don't have a good answer. But nonetheless, it's the kind of question raised in [an interesting essay by Michael Dean](https://blog.cosmos-institute.org/p/essay-writing-as-personal-sovereignty).
