curatorNotes: "This piece connects Graeber's bullshit jobs theory with AI disruption in a way that feels both timely and inevitable. The observation that corporate jobs are becoming funding mechanisms for side projects while AI removes entry-level rungs is particularly sharp. What's most unsettling is the suggestion that we're in a transition period where the old system hasn't collapsed yet, but belief in it has already died."
excerpt: "Alex connects David Graeber's bullshit jobs theory with AI disruption, arguing that while meaningless corporate work persists, it's increasingly becoming just a paycheck to fund real entrepreneurial work—and AI is removing the entry-level rungs that once led to corporate careers."
pullQuote: "Their corporate job becomes a funding source. This suggests we're in a transition period: the jobs haven't ended yet, but belief in the corporate job as a meaningful institution seems to be diminishing."

[This article was going viral](https://thestillwandering.substack.com/p/the-death-of-the-corporate-job) on Substack and elsewhere, and I think the context in which it's going viral is important. The backdrop is the **threat of AI** and the potential of this "civilizational moment," as the godmother of AI [Fei-Fei Li](/articles/whither-agi-fei-fei-li) once called it.

The core of the article is essentially an extended rehashing of **David Graeber's "bullshit jobs" theory**—the idea that the vast majority of jobs are pointless and shouldn't exist. The author, Alex, points out that whenever he speaks to people, he often hears the same thing: when asked to explain their jobs, most people not only struggle but sometimes even admit outright that their job is a "bullshit job."

What's surprising, though, is that these jobs aren't disappearing. Instead, many people use them as a paycheck while, in parallel, building entrepreneurial projects outside of work. Their corporate job becomes a funding source. This suggests we're in a **transition period**: the jobs haven't ended yet, but belief in the corporate job as a meaningful institution seems to be diminishing—almost like the slow decline of organized religion.

I slightly disagree with the author here. I think this decline is happening faster than he suggests. It's hard to get solid data yet, but there are early signs that **AI isn't eliminating all jobs, but it is disrupting entry-level ones**. Many tasks once handled by graduates, interns, or junior employees are increasingly automated by large language models. This has effectively **removed the lowest rungs of the corporate ladder**.

We're already seeing reports of Ivy League graduates, PhDs, and other highly educated people struggling to find jobs. Another possible angle, as [Brian Merchant](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/how-ai-is-killing-jobs-in-the-tech-f39) points out, is that companies are using AI as an excuse to **downsize the workforce** under the banner of "shareholder value."

So overall, it's an interesting read—one that connects Graeber's old theory of bullshit jobs with the new pressures and disruptions brought by AI.
