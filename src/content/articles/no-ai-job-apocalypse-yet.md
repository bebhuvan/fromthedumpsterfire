curatorNotes: "Harvard's new Dean offers the establishment's optimistic take on AI disruption, arguing that technological upheaval creates opportunities for ambitious young people. His dismissal of AI job fears as 'misplaced doom and gloom' feels premature—especially when he admits AI can already do entry-level college work better than humans. The cognitive dissonance is striking: acknowledge the threat, then wave it away with historical analogies."
excerpt: "David Deming, Harvard's new Dean, pushes back against AI job apocalypse fears, arguing that CEOs use AI as a convenient scapegoat and that technological disruption historically creates opportunities for the educated elite."
pullQuote: "CEOs really are talking a lot about AI, but that's partly because it's a convenient scapegoat. If your company's suddenly struggling and you are looking around for someone to blame, AI makes a great target."

[A counterpoint](https://forklightning.substack.com/p/shorting-the-ai-jobs-apocalypse) to the doom and gloom about AI taking jobs by David Deming, the new Dean of Harvard College: 

> CEOs really are talking a lot about AI, but that's partly because it's
> a convenient scapegoat. If your company's suddenly struggling and you
> are looking around for someone to blame, AI makes a great target.
> Chatbots don't fight back. And if you have to explain to shareholders
> why you missed your earnings target, you'll point the finger at the
> _deus ex machina_ of technological apocalypse, rather than at your own decision-making.
> 
> Having said all that, I do sympathize with those who fear for the
> future of entry-level college jobs at big companies. AI really can do
> the work of new college graduates – writing, research support,
> analyzing and synthesizing data – better than it can do the work of
> say, a plumber or a gardener.
> 
> AI makes formerly safe career ladders seem wobbly. As students, you've
> suddenly been given access to a technology that could write your
> essays and answer the hardest questions on your PSets in minutes
> (which you really shouldn't do). It's fair to wonder whether this
> weird, alien intelligence that's available at the low price of free or
> $20 per month has reduced the need in the broader world for young,
> talented Harvard students like yourselves.
> 
> But I want to be clear, I believe this doom and gloom is misplaced.
> (If I thought otherwise, I wouldn't be bringing it up on a joyous
> occasion like this.) Traditional, "safe" pathways in big established
> companies may very well be at risk from AI. But you, Class of 2029,
> have lots of other options. You don't need to follow those well-worn
> paths. In fact, you may be better off without them. History tells us
> that periods of technological disruption and economic distress are
> [windows of
> opportunity](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/am-pdf/10.1111/jofi.13097)
> for educated, ambitious young people like yourselves to join – or
> start - something new.

I totally disagree.
