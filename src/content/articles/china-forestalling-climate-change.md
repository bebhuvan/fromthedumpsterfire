curatorNotes: "Noah Smith's thread cuts through climate doom narratives with hard data. China's fossil fuel demand has plateaued while their solar exports are reshaping global energy markets. The charts tell a remarkable story—China isn't just decoupling growth from emissions, they're becoming the world's clean energy factory. This contradicts both Western pessimism about Chinese climate action and the idea that economic growth necessarily means more emissions."
excerpt: "Noah Smith argues that China's fossil fuel demand has plateaued while their massive solar exports are single-handedly forestalling global climate change, backed by compelling data from Ember Energy."

[China is single-handedly forestalling climate change](https://x.com/Noahpinion/status/1965815338014281779), according to Noah Smith's thread:

The data tells a remarkable story. China's fossil fuel demand appears to have plateaued:

Meanwhile, China has become the world's solar energy factory, with exports that are reshaping global clean energy markets:

This represents a fundamental shift in the climate narrative. While Western discourse often focuses on China as a major polluter, the reality is more nuanced. China is simultaneously:

1. **Plateauing domestic fossil fuel consumption** - Breaking the link between economic growth and emissions
2. **Flooding global markets with cheap solar panels** - Making clean energy economically competitive worldwide
3. **Manufacturing the infrastructure** needed for a global energy transition

The implications are profound. China isn't just cleaning up its own act—it's providing the tools for the rest of the world to decarbonize at scale and speed.
