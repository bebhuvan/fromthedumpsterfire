curatorNotes: "Butler's distinction between capitalism and 'metastatic market fundamentalism' cuts through the usual left-right noise. The social media example is perfect—algorithms designed to maximize ad revenue by exploiting our limbic systems, creating political division and mental health crises. We've moved from serving customers to treating citizens as feedstock."
excerpt: "Adam Butler argues we haven't practiced capitalism for 40 years, but rather a 'horrific experiment called neoliberalism' that treats citizens as feedstock for corporate profits instead of serving customer needs."
pullQuote: "The system isn't designed to protect the rights of Americans to not be exploited by corporations for profit. The system is designed to protect corporations' rights to extract maximum profit from citizens."

[Interesting take on capitalism by Adam Butler](https://x.com/GestaltU/status/1966844702390403166):

> Here's a hard truth about modern society. We don't practice Capitalism anymore. Rather, for the last 40 years we've been conducting a horrific experiment called "neoliberalism". And we're near the terminal point in that experiment, a stage I've been calling metastatic market fundamentalism. 
> 
> Capitalism is agents organizing to seek profit by serving the needs and wants of customers. Metastatic market fundamentalism treats citizens as feedstock for corporate profits. 
> 
> Social media is a canonical example. It's established fact that Twitter, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram etc. algorithms, which are tuned to maximize advertising revenues via limbic activation, and produce political division and derangement, depression, and a host of other problems. 
> 
> But regulating against these algorithms might impair corporate profits, so America doesn't regulate them. Because the system isn't designed to protect the rights of Americans to not be exploited by corporations for profit. The system is to designed to protect corporations' rights to extract maximum profit from citizens.

> This is pathological sociopathy at societal scale.
