curatorNotes: "This pairs beautifully with the bubble piece—Kuppy does the brutal math on AI capex spending and finds it doesn't add up. $480 billion needed just to cover 2025 investments, when Netflix only does $39 billion with 300 million subscribers. The numbers are astronomical and there simply aren't enough revenue streams to justify current spending, let alone the exponential growth trajectory."
excerpt: "Harris Kupperman runs the numbers on AI capital expenditure and finds a terrifying gap: the industry needs $480 billion in revenue just to cover 2025 investments, but there simply aren't enough paying customers to make it work."
pullQuote: "At the current trajectory, we're going to hit a wall, and soon. There just isn't enough revenue and there never can be enough revenue."

[Harris "Kuppy" Kupperman says](https://pracap.com/global-crossing-reborn) the math behind the AI dream doesn't add up: 

> Now, I think AI grows. I think the use-cases grow. I think the revenue grows. I think they eventually charge more for products that I didn't even know could exist. However, $480 billion is a LOT of revenue for guys like me who don't even pay a monthly fee today for the product. To put this into perspective, Netflix had $39 billion in revenue in 2024 on roughly 300 million subscribers, or less than 10% of the required revenue, yet having rather fully tapped out the TAM of users who will pay a subscription for a product like this. Microsoft Office 365 got to $ 95 billion in commercial and consumer spending in 2024, and then even Microsoft ran out of people to sell the product to. $480 billion is just an astronomical number.
> 
> Of course, corporations will adopt AI as they see productivity improvements. Governments have unlimited capital—they love overpaying for stuff. Maybe you can ultimately jam $480 billion of this stuff down their throats. The problem is that $480 billion in revenue isn't for all of the world's future AI needs, it's the revenue simply needed to cover the 2025 capex spend. What if they spend twice as much in 2026?? What if you need almost $1 trillion in revenue to cover the 2026 vintage of spend?? At some point, you outrun even the government's capacity to waste money (shocking!!)

> Simply put, at the current trajectory, we're going to hit a wall, and soon. There just isn't enough revenue and there never can be enough revenue. The world just doesn't have the ability to pay for this much AI. It isn't about making the product better or charging more for the product. There just isn't enough revenue to cover the current capex spend.
