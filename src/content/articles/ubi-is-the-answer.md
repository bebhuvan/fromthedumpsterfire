curatorNotes: "A thread that perfectly captures the UBI paradox—we'll become 'wealthier in temporal/monetary terms than ever and socially poorer.' The mental health and inequality implications of a leisure economy are rarely discussed this clearly. The shrug emoji at the end says everything about our resignation to this trajectory."
excerpt: "Cullen Roche's thread on UBI and automation paints a picture of the 'Keynesian Leisure economy'—where we become temporally and monetarily wealthier but socially poorer, with massive disparities in relative leisure."

[UBI is the answer?](https://x.com/cullenroche/status/1956069299594125539) Cullen Roche's thread:

"Nah. It's the Keynesian Utopia. The value of labor will fall, but productivity will increase. And we will spend less time working because so much of it will become automated. A UBI will expand and the economy turns increasingly into the Keynesian Leisure economy.

Footnote: The disparity in relative "leisure" will expand massively which will also exacerbate the mental health crisis and wealth inequality we are already experiencing. So we will become wealthier in temporal/monetary terms than ever and we will become socially poorer. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"
