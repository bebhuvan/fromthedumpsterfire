curatorNotes: "Classic Niederhoffer - deceptively simple life advice from one of Wall Street's most legendary (and volatile) figures. The mix of financial wisdom ('follow drift upward in stocks'), health tips ('eat fish in high proportion to meat'), and philosophical insights ('your family is perhaps your only loyal support') reads like distilled experience from someone who's seen extreme highs and lows."
excerpt: "Legendary trader Vic Niederhoffer shares 11 pieces of life advice, from 'be humble' and 'follow drift upward in stocks' to 'wear a hat' and 'eat fish in high proportion to meat.'"
pullQuote: "Your family is your major and perhaps only loyal support you can count on."
