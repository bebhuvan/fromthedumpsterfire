curatorNotes: "Do you ever feel like everything around you looks and feels the same? As if there's no creativity, no variation? Do you sense a kind of homogeneity everywhere — people playing it safe, less willing to take risks, more eager to conform? If you've ever had that feeling, then this article is for you. Adam Mastroianni assembles a remarkable range of data points showing there's been a sort of recession in weirdness everywhere. Teenage deviance is down. Adult crime is down. Serial killings are down. Cults are collapsing. Culture is stagnating—we're reading the same comic-book heroes from the 1960s, and 75% of today's top films are sequels or spinoffs. Music sounds homogeneous. Novel covers look alike. The internet isn't weird anymore. Every website follows the same minimalist template. Every café and Airbnb looks identical. Brand logos have converged on sans-serif fonts. Architecture, cars, offices—all flattened into gray. Why does this matter? Because if everyone thinks the same way and plays it safe, where will innovation come from? Deviant thinking has always been at the heart of discovery and art. Mastroianni even shows data suggesting scientific progress itself has slowed. His theory about why this is happening is fascinating—it's about how the value of life itself has changed."
excerpt: "People are less weird than they used to be. From crime rates to cult formation, from scientific breakthroughs to website design, deviance is declining across every sector of society. Adam Mastroianni asks: in becoming safer and richer, have we sacrificed the strange thinking that drives progress?"
pullQuote: "For the first time in history, weirdness is a choice. And it's a hard one, because we have more to lose than ever."

## The Thesis

People are less weird than they used to be. Not just subjectively—the data from every sector points to a **recession of mischief, crisis of conventionality, epidemic of the mundane**. Deviance is declining.

This isn't a recent internet phenomenon. It started in the 1980s-2000s across different domains. And it's not purely bad—it's miraculous and dismal simultaneously.

## The Evidence

### Teenagers Are Saints Now

High schoolers are **less than half as likely** to drink alcohol as in the 1990s. They're also less likely to:
- Smoke, have sex, or fight
- Use drugs (meth, ecstasy, hallucinogens, painkillers)
- Even vaping declined from 2015-2023
- Bring guns to school (down dramatically)
- Get pregnant

This isn't survey bias—teenage pregnancy rates confirm the trend with hard data.

### Adults Behave Better Too

- Crime rates: **down 50%** in 30 years
- Serial killing: **on the decline**
- Cult formation: **collapsed after the 1980s**
- Anti-social behavior: **steep decline**

Good deviance is disappearing too. Americans are **less likely to move** since the mid-1980s. "The typical adult lives only 18 miles from their mother."

### Creativity Is Dying

All popular art forms have become **oligopolies**. Before 2000: 25% of top-grossing movies were sequels/spinoffs. Now: **75%**.

The same pattern in TV, music, video games, books. Popular music is more **homogenous** and has more **repetitive lyrics** than ever.

Every novel cover looks the same. Every website converged on sleek minimalism. The internet changed dramatically from 1990s→2000s→2010s, but **hasn't changed much since 2010s**.

### The Physical World Looks Identical

- Every cafe: same bourgeois boho style
- Every apartment building: same design
- Every AirBnB: same aesthetic
- Every logo: sans serif wordmark
- Most cars: black, silver, gray, or white

### Science Has Stagnated

- Fewer **disruptive discoveries**
- Less **impressive breakthroughs** (per expert ratings)
- Fewer **major innovations per capita**
- Scientific papers: **all sound the same**, follow identical format
- The "weird nerds" are **fleeing academia**

## The Cause

**Life is worth more now.** Not morally—literally.

The "value of a statistical life" (how much people will pay to reduce death risk) has **skyrocketed**, even faster than GDP growth.

Two reasons:
1. **We're richer** (can afford to de-risk)
2. **Life is less dangerous** (making remaining risks more salient)

When you're born into milk and honey, you adopt a **"slow life history strategy"**—Pilates over drunk driving, 401(k) over unprotected sex. Everything must last: joints, skin, **reputation**.

### The Grandfather Test

Both Mastroianni's grandfathers died in their 60s (on track with life expectancy when born). They:
- Grew up during Depression
- Lived without electricity/plumbing
- Were drafted to Korean War
- Couldn't be "precious" about life

Compare that to today: big-screen TV, sushi delivery, life expectancy of 80+. Why risk all this?

Things done casually then—smoking, hitchhiking in truck beds, postponing medical treatment—feel **unthinkable now**.

## The Trap

We start following rules, never stop, then **forget rules can be broken**. Most rule-breaking is bad, but some is necessary. We've lost both simultaneously.

### The Harvard Paradox

Getting an elite degree should **increase options**. Instead, it makes students too afraid to choose any but the safest. 50% of Harvard grads go to **finance, tech, consulting**.

Not because they love PowerPoints or profit optimization, but because these jobs are **safe, lucrative, prestigious**. They dreamed of what they'd gain; they didn't realize they'd gain **something to lose**.

The richest students pick the **safest careers**. More money = more to protect.

## The Artist Who Dug Holes

Arturo Di Modica:
- Ran away from Sicily to study art in Florence
- Immigrated to US, worked as mechanic/technician
- Bought dilapidated NYC building, **illegally built his own studio** (including two sub-basements) by hand
- Refused art dealers until age 70
- Created *Charging Bull* statue, **deposited it on Wall Street without permission**
- City impounded it, public outcry brought it back
- His message: "If you want to do something in a moment things are very bad, you can do it. **You can do it by yourself**."

Compare that to *Fearless Girl* (2017): **commissioned by investment company to promote an index fund**.

## The Challenge

Who would live Di Modica's life now? Every step is inadvisable. Even if someone tried, the systems would shut them down—schools force you home, real estate is unaffordable, cities shut you down.

**The decline of deviance is mainly good.** Lives are longer, safer, healthier, richer.

But making trivial risks seem terrifying means we've tamed every frontier. We need:
- **New institutions**
- New eddies and corners
- Tucked-away spaces where **strange things can grow**

## The Choice

For the first time in history, **weirdness is a choice**. A hard one. We have more to lose than ever.

If we want interesting art and enlightening science, we must **tolerate illegal holes in the basement**. And somebody must be brave enough to **climb down into them**.
