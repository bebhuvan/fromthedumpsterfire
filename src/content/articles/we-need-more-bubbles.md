curatorNotes: "A refreshingly contrarian take that reframes economic 'bubbles' as civilization's innovation engine. Lewis channels Hobart and Huber's thesis about productive bubbles being necessary accelerants rather than pathologies. The parallel between the Manhattan Project, Apollo Program, and today's AI spending spree is compelling—all were 'reality-bending delusions' that required collective hallucination to achieve the impossible."
excerpt: "Colin Lewis argues that AI overspending isn't a bug but a feature—bubbles are civilization's way of coordinating massive resources around transformative technologies, turning irrational exuberance into innovation breakthroughs."
pullQuote: "Bubbles, irrational, frenzied manias, are not pathologies but necessary accelerants of progress. Without them, stagnation hardens into a terminal condition."

Couldn't agree more. It might sound dumb, but without bubbles, there's no innovation. The wasteful spending is the price you pay for the next big thing. [Fully agree with Colin Lewis:](https://onepercentrule.substack.com/p/why-the-overspending-on-ai-is-necessary?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android&r=1eft5&triedRedirect=true)
