# Content Creation Guide

A guide for creating compelling content for From The Dumpster Fire.

## üìù Content Philosophy

### What We Curate
- Thoughtful essays that make you think
- Educational videos and documentaries
- Insightful podcasts and interviews
- Research papers (made accessible)
- Historical letters and correspondence
- Poetry that resonates
- Art that tells a story

### What We Avoid
- Clickbait and hot takes
- Rage bait or divisive content for its own sake
- Surface-level content
- Content that's all noise, no signal

## ‚úçÔ∏è Writing Overviews (Not Summaries)

### The Difference

**Summary**: "This article discusses the decline of religion globally, analyzing data from 111 countries."

**Overview**: "Religion doesn't vanish overnight. It fades in sequence, following the same pattern across cultures. This study reveals that people shed commitments by cost: attendance goes first, then personal importance, finally identity."

### Key Principles

1. **Hook Immediately**: Open with the most interesting insight
2. **Plain English**: Sophisticated but never stuffy
3. **Dense with Insight**: Every sentence should add value
4. **Show Don't Tell**: Demonstrate why it matters
5. **Leave Them Curious**: Make them want to read the original

### Structure (200-600 words)

```
Opening Hook (1-2 sentences)
‚Üì
Key Insight #1 (1 paragraph)
‚Üì
Key Insight #2 (1 paragraph)
‚Üì
Key Insight #3 (1 paragraph)
‚Üì
Why It Matters (1 paragraph)
‚Üì
[Optional] Provocative Ending
```

- "attention-economy"
- "urban-isolation"
- "meaning-crisis"

Use 2-5 topics per piece. Be specific enough to be useful for discovery.

## ‚ú® Curator Notes

This is YOUR voice. Be:

- **Personal**: How did this affect you?
- **Honest**: Real reactions, not marketing copy
- **Insightful**: What did you see that others might miss?
- **Concise**: 2-4 sentences max

### Examples

**Good**:
> "This essay crystallizes something I've felt for years but couldn't articulate. The constant dumbing down of tools in the name of 'accessibility' is actually making them less accessible to those who want to go deep."

**Bad**:
> "This is a great article about product design. You should read it. It has good points about users."
